# Feedback PL4 DART-N

Sorry for the late feedback, there was some confusion as to how to and when to send the rubrics to you guys. Below you will find the rubrics for sprint 1.

Note: The Code Evolution Quality part does not count this week. 

A brief explanation for the low grades: I saw close to no testing. And, besides setting up the tooling, you should use the tooling and have no alerts on there. 

Comments on the Architecture Design document will be there Monday.

If you have any questions, please ask them tonight, as I will be away until Monday.
