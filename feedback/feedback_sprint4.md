## Notes
sprint:
-splitting: Ricardo less hours?
-definition: tasks not really fitting for the stories
-responsibilities: differ per person

reflection:
-estimation: did not estimate for everyone going on holiday
-reflection: not a lot happened with 2 people, so simple reflection.

EAD:
-No new version
-Previous feedback should be fixed

EAD-changes
-Same as previous feedback

CQ:
-Same as previous feedback

Readability:
-Formatting: Sometimes lots of code

Testing:
-(still) too little
-Building sometimes merged when failing
