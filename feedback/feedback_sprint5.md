## Notes
Please, be more consistent with where and how you upload your files (naming, location etc.)

Sprint
Definition: 5
-Define tasks as to *what* should be improved or fixed. 
-Help with improve node collapsing should not be a task
-Testing should be done per PR, not individual tasks

Splitting: 10

Responsibility: 7
-Off a bit, Niek is responsible for a lot of A tasks while others not so much

Reflection
Not really consistent with previous retrospectives; where are the notes?

Reflection: 3
-Lots of problems with this retrospective of last week: 
-Where are the notes on tasks that were not finished?
-Main problems should have an assertive reaction on how you're going to fix this and how it won't happen again in the future
-Static Analysis and code review should not be something worth noting hours for

Estimation: 7

Priority: 10

Architecture
Changes: 5
Document: 5
-No new version
-Should still implement feedback of last weeks
-After refactoring it's quite different

CQ: 8
-Unused code 
-Still no optimal use of JavaFX

Readability
Formatting: 9
Naming: 10
Comments: 10

CI
Building: 8
Testing: 4
-Testing not enough
-Should be done per PR

Tooling: 9
-Maven still giving exceptions 
-Some minor errors

PBD
Branching: 10
Code Review: 9
-Always comment with a final check (to check whether the fix was correct)

## Announcements
We will not have the regular SE Meeting next Friday because of the Serial Meetings we will have with Bacchelli. You will need to prepare a 10-15 minute demo and sell your product. 
 
Besides that please fill in this survey for your feedback on me [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eprgikpJsNbVj6x0CDLeKqxsdnkfd1P9k9Qdn8kkqr8/viewform#start=openform)
